<p>Technologies Used:</p>
<p>Java, JDBC, JUnit, Maven, Eclipse, DBeaver, Command Line, Git, GitHub</p>
<hr/>

<p>Utilizing core Java concepts, this console-based banking application was built solely on the back end. Using JRE v1.8, I've created a simple application that 
allows the user to make a selection by input (scanner.io) through various conditional statements using switch cases. These inputs are then stored in the database, and all records are kept for these accounts. A user can: </p>

<ol>
	<li>Login to their respective accounts, as either a customer or employee</li>
	<li>Customers are allowed to open a bank account, to which they can deposit and withdraw funds from</li>
	<li>Customers can view their balances</li>
	<li>Employees can view a record of customer transactions</li>
	<li>Employees can delete and reject customer accounts</li>
	<li>The System administrator validates and controls account overdraft</li>
</ol>
